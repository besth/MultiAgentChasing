1. Test the effect of killzone size on the corner.
- settings:
    - positions: prey: (9, 9). predator: (7.5, 7.5). Predator action *= 5 position difference.

- steps:
    1. tested with killzone size = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0]. Max-steps=10. Rollout=10. num-sim=250. num-tests=50.
    2. Threshold size ~0.7/0.8. Then increase the num-sim to 1000 for the two sizes next to the threshold. Make sure the
        simulation number does not matter (i.e. the threshold size stays the same).
    3. compare: (1). With small killzone, mcts can always run out of corner, while random does not. So significantly better performance.
                (2). With large killzone, mcts will run towards the corner. Max survival time is 4. It should be slightly better than random.
                (With increased number of tests)
