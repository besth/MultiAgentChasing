1) Remove the parameter 'useHeuristic'.
2) Evaluate in runMCTSInMujoco uses a transition function even before MCTS starts. Fix that.
3) Currently, the MCTS algorithm returns the next root instead of the next action. While it is okay in our scenario, it is not very consistent with the actual algorithm.
4) The tests involving Mujoco aren't working from inside the tests folder. Maybe I'll have to add a sys_path or something like that.
